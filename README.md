<h1>Memory Analysis Lab (Using Volatility)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a report of the findings in a fictional scenario in which we have received an image of a compromised device, and it is our job to figure out how it is compromised. To do so, we'll use the memory analysis tool "Volatility" to be able to examine the image and try to pin down the indicators of compromise (IoC) in this device. After our initial investigation is complete, we'll check our findings using "Snort" to validate our claims and cover any IoCs that we may have missed.
